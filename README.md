# 🚀 ZEPTO-STYLE DELIVERY OPTIMIZATION  

This is a complete analytics project I worked on to simulate a **quick commerce delivery system** (like Zepto or Blinkit).  
The main idea was to see how deliveries, agents, and zones perform, and to practice combining **Python, SQL, and Power BI** in a single end-to-end project.

## 📂 PROJECT STRUCTURE  

data/ → contains all CSV files (agents, customers, orders, order_items, products, deliveries)
python/ → Jupyter Notebook with data analysis
sql/ → SQL queries for different business questions
powerbi/ → Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)


---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE  

The goal of this project is simple:  
- Understand delivery performance (on-time vs late)  
- Check how agents and zones are performing  
- Find patterns in delays (time slots, weather, demand)  
- Present everything in a clear dashboard for easy understanding  

---

## 🛠 TOOLS USED  

- **Python** → for data cleaning, exploration, and visualizations  
- **SQL (MySQL)** → for solving business queries  
- **Power BI** → for creating an interactive dashboard

## 📊 WHAT I BUILT  

### Python Phase  
- Worked with 50K+ synthetic records of orders, deliveries, agents, and customers  
- Did basic EDA → average delivery times, delay patterns, agent ratings  
- Visualized results like zone-wise delays and delivery trends  

### SQL Phase  
- Wrote queries to answer business-related questions like:  
  - How many orders were placed?  
  - On-time vs late delivery counts  
  - Zone with the highest late %  
  - Top agents by number of deliveries  
- Practiced joins, group by, aggregations, etc.  

### Power BI Phase  
- Built a **one-page dashboard** with:  
  - KPIs (total deliveries, on-time %, avg delivery time)  
  - Zone-wise late delivery chart  
  - Delivery trend line chart  
  - Agent performance comparison  

---

## 🔑 KEY INSIGHTS  

- Around **95% of deliveries are on time**.  
- **Central zone has the most late deliveries**, likely due to traffic or high demand.  
- Average delivery time is around **13 minutes**.  
- Almost **90% of orders are delivered within 15 minutes**.
